# Game of Life Implementation Walkthrough

This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough of implementing Conway's Game 
of Life using HTML5 Canvas with a GitHub contribution graph-inspired theme.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Grid System**
   - Dynamic grid sizing based on window dimensions
   - Wrapped edges (cells at borders connect to opposite side)
   - Cell size of 10x10 pixels

2. **Visualization**
   - GitHub-inspired color scheme for cell density
   - Color gradients based on neighbor count
   - Smooth rendering using requestAnimationFrame

3. **Game Rules**
   - Standard Conway's Game of Life rules
   - Any live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
   - Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
   - All other cells die or stay dead

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses modern JavaScript features and follows best practices for
canvas-based animations. Key technical aspects include:

- Efficient grid updates using array mapping
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Proper event listener cleanup
- Responsive canvas sizing
