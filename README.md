## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-of-life-walkthrough.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

## How It Works

This implementation follows Conway's Game of Life rules while visualizing cell
density using GitHub's contribution graph colors. The intensity of each cell's
color is determined by its neighbor count.

For a detailed walkthrough of the implementation, see 
[walkthrough-README.md](walkthrough-README.md).
